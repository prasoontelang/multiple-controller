  [ Open vSwitch team ]
  * New upstream version
    - New "VLAN splinters" feature to work around buggy device drivers
      in old Linux versions.  (This feature is deprecated.  When
      broken device drivers are no longer in widespread use, we will
      delete this feature.)  See ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5) for more
      information.
    - OpenFlow:
       - Added ability to match on IPv6 flow label through NXM.
       - Added ability to match on ECN bits in IPv4 and IPv6 through NXM.
       - Added ability to match on TTL in IPv4 and IPv6 through NXM.
       - Added ability to modify ECN bits in IPv4.
       - Added ability to modify TTL in IPv4.
    - ovs-vswitchd:
       - Don't require the "normal" action to use mirrors.  Traffic will
         now be properly mirrored for any flows, regardless of their
         actions.
       - Track packet and byte statistics sent on mirrors.
    - ovs-appctl:
      - New "fdb/flush" command to flush bridge's MAC learning table.
    - ovs-test:
      - A new distributed testing tool that allows one to diagnose performance
        and connectivity issues. This tool currently is not included in RH or
        Xen packages.
    - RHEL packaging now supports integration with Red Hat network scripts.
    - Debian: Depend on python (>= 2.7) | python-argparse instead of
              python-argparse to avoid pulling in python2.6
              (closes: #653645)

openvswitch (1.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low
  [ Open vSwitch team ]
  * New upstream version
    - OpenFlow:
      - Added an OpenFlow extension which allows the "output" action to accept
        NXM fields.
      - Added an OpenFlow extension for flexible learning.
      - Bumped number of NXM registers from four to five.
    - ovs-appctl:
      - New "version" command to determine version of running daemon.
      - If no argument is provided for "cfm/show", displays detailed
        information about all interfaces with CFM enabled.
      - If no argument is provided for "lacp/show", displays detailed
        information about all ports with LACP enabled.
    - ovs-vswitchd:
      - The software switch now supports 255 OpenFlow tables, instead
        of just one.  By default, only table 0 is consulted, but the
        new NXAST_RESUBMIT_TABLE action can look up in additional
        tables.  Tables 128 and above are reserved for use by the
        switch itself; please use only tables 0 through 127.
      - Add support for 802.1D spanning tree (STP).
    - Fragment handling extensions:
      - New OFPC_FRAG_NX_MATCH fragment handling mode, in which L4
        fields are made available for matching in fragments with
        offset 0.
      - New NXM_NX_IP_FRAG match field for matching IP fragments (usable
        via "ip_frag" in ovs-ofctl).
      - New ovs-ofctl "get-frags" and "set-frags" commands to get and set
        fragment handling policy.
    - CAPWAP tunneling now supports an extension to transport a 64-key.  By
      default it remains compatible with the old version and other
      standards-based implementations.
    - Flow setups are now processed in a round-robin manner across ports
      to prevent any single client from monopolizing the CPU and conducting
      a denial of service attack.
    - Added support for native VLAN tagging.  A new "vlan_mode"
      parameter can be set for "port". Possible values: "access",
      "trunk", "native-tagged" and "native-untagged".
    - test-openflowd has been removed.  Please use ovs-vswitchd instead.

  * New upstream version
    - New "ofproto" abstraction layer to ease porting to hardware
      switching ASICs.
    - Packaging for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 and 6.0.
    - Datapath support for Linux kernels up to 3.0.
    - OpenFlow:
      - New "bundle" and "bundle_load" action extensions.
    - Database:
      - Implement table unique constraints.
      - Support cooperative locking between callers.
    - ovs-dpctl:
      - New "-s" option for "show" command prints packet and byte
        counters for each port.
    - ovs-ofctl:
      - New "--readd" option for "replace-flows".
    - ovs-vsctl:
      - New "show" command to print an overview of configuration.
      - New "comment" command to add remark that explains intentions.
    - ovs-brcompatd has been rewritten to fix long-standing bugs.
    - ovs-openflowd has been renamed test-openflowd and moved into the
      tests directory.  Its presence confused too many users.  Please
      use ovs-vswitchd instead.
    - New ovs-benchmark utility to test flow setup performance.
    - A new log level "off" has been added.  Configuring a log facility
      "off" prevents any messages from being logged to it.  Previously,
      "emer" was effectively "off" because no messages were ever logged at
      level "emer".  Now, errors that cause a process to exit are logged
      at "emer" level.
    - "configure" option --with-l26 has been renamed --with-linux, and
      --with-l26-source has been renamed --with-linux-source.  The old
      names will be removed after the next release, so please update
      your scripts.
    - The "-2.6" suffix has been dropped from the datapath/linux-2.6 and
      datapath/linux-2.6/compat-2.6 directories.
    - Feature removals:
      - Dropped support for "tun_id_from_cookie" OpenFlow extension.
        Please use the extensible match extensions instead.
      - Removed the Maintenance_Point and Monitor tables in an effort

    - Kernel:
      - Kernel<->userspace interface has been reworked and should be
        close to a stable ABI now.
      - "Port group" concept has been dropped.
    - GRE over IPSEC tunnels

      - New commands for working with the new Managers table.
      - "list" command enhanced with new formatting options and --columns
        option.

        current implementation.
      - New experimental "note" action.
      - New "ofproto/trace" ovs-appctl command and associated utilities
        to ease debugging complex flow tables.
    - Database:
      - Schema documentation now includes an entity-relationship diagram.
      - The database is now garbage collected.  In most tables,
        unreferenced rows will be deleted automatically.
      - Many tables now include statistics updated periodically by
        ovs-vswitchd or ovsdb-server.
      - Every table now has an "external-ids" column for use by OVS
        integrators.
      - There is no default controller anymore.  Each bridge must have its
        controller individually specified.
      - The "fail-mode" is now a property of a Bridge instead of a Controller.
      - New versioning and checksum features.
      - New Managers table and manager_options column in Open_vSwitch table
        for specifying managers.  The old "managers" column in the

    - Feature removals:
      - Dropped support for XenServer pre-5.6.100.
      - Dropped support for Linux pre-2.6.18.
      - Dropped controller discovery support.

      - Dropped the "corekeeper" package (now separate, at
        http://openvswitch.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=corekeeper).
